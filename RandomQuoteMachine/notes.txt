Got it.
You’re attempting to access via HTTPS. If you use HTTP, it works fine.
However, because you’re using GitHub, which is HTTPS, you’ll get cross-origin errors.
Try using Crossorigin.me
For example, https://crossorigin.me/http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=jsonp&jsonp=showQuote&lang=en&key=10153

data-jsonp.js:7 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://asonder.github.io/random-quote-machine/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=jsonp&jsonp=showQuote&lang=en&key=49152&callback=?'.
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.



after the dom is loaded,
a script element is created that makes
a jsonp ajax request


the same occurs when you press the "new quote"
button



could i just make the ajax call instead of
adding the script element?

don't use the jsonp url variable
